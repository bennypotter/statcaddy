Testing Framework
=========

The Statcaddy framework used GoogleTest-1.7.0 to automate its unit testing.

To set up googletest do the following:
1. download the 1.7.0 source
2. $mkdir gtest_src/lib
3. $cd gtest_src/lib
4. cmake ..
5. make

At this point compiled librarires will be in the lib directory and
include files will be in gtest_src/include directory.
